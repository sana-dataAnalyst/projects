# 🧼 SQL Data Cleaning Project – Layoffs Dataset

## 📋 Description
Tech firms around the globe are fighting the economic slowdown. Tech firms have started laying employees off. for instance, Meta recently fired 13% of its workforce, 
which amounts to more than 11,000 employees.
This project involves cleaning a real-world dataset on companies layoffs from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic (11 March 2020) to present (21 Apr 2025), using MySQL. 
I handled missing values, standardized date formats, and removed unnecessary columns to prepare the data for analysis.
