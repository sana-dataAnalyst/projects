## Overview:

### Project1: Vehicle CO2 Emissions Analysis

Vehicles are a significant source of CO₂ emissions in the environment. In this analysis, I conducted an exploratory data analysis and implemented a multiple linear regression model to assess the extent to which various features influence CO₂ emissions.


### Project2: Predicting Renewable energy consumption

The use of renewable energy has increased over the years, driven by factors such as political policies, environmental concerns, public health considerations, and economic incentives.
In this project, I analyzed energy consumption patterns and developed forecasts for future usage using ARIMA and SARIMA models.


### Project3: Weather Forecasting Application

This project was an opportunity for me to create an application that predicts the weather condition with just using zip code or city, using the free open weather map platform.


### Project4: Sales Time Series Modeling

In this analysis, I systematically prepared the dataset and conducted a comparative evaluation of the Holt-Winters and SARIMAX models for sales forecasting.


### Project5: Customers Segmentation

This project presents an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my ability to apply the K-Means clustering model to effectively segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups.


### Project6: Movie reviews Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I utilized the TextBlob library to perform sentiment classification on movie reviews and evaluated its performance in comparison to random guessing.


### Project7: Healthcare fraud detection

In this analysis, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, exploration and preprocessing, followed by the development of a logistic regression model to identify fraudulent claims within Medicare and Medicaid organizations.


### Project8: Coin Market Automating API

In this project, I implemented an automated process to extract cryptocurrency market data using an API.


### 9-Project9: Spam Emails Detection

Receiving spams whether through emails, messages or modern channels is a huge challenge for individuals and organizations. This project was an opportunity for me to implement the random forest classifier to effectively classify emails into spams or not spams.
